	<p>Hi there, welcome to my homepage! I am an incoming 2nd-year PhD student at Northwestern University studying Engineering Sciences and Applied Math. 
	I am interested in studying physical phenomena appearing in different fields and use mathematics to explain them. I like applying visulization techniques to gain insights into
	complicated mathematical functions.
	My current research is about understanding the fluid mechanics in the Esophagus. Most of the research will involve numerical simulations and learning.<a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a></p>
