I grew up in Shanghai, China and obtained my B.A. degree from Wheaton College, MA. I was double majoring in Mathematics and Physics, minoring in Piano Performance and Astronomy. I am interested in addressing problems appearing in natural science, especially physics and astronomy, with mathematical modelling and analytical and numerical solutions. I will start my PhD program in applied math at Northwestern in fall 2020.  </p>
