<p>I grew up in Shanghai, China and obtained my B.A. degree from Wheaton College, MA. I was double majoring in Mathematics and Physics, minoring in Piano Performance and Astronomy.
I started my PhD program in Engineering Sciences and Applied Mathematics at Northwestern in fall 2020. In my leisure time, I like playing the piano and listening to classical music.
You can find some of the recordings of me playing the piano pieces <a href="/recordings">here.   </p>
