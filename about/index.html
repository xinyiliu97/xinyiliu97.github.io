<p>I grew up in Shanghai, China and obtained my B.A. degree from Wheaton College, MA.
I started my PhD program in Engineering Sciences and Applied Mathematics at Northwestern in fall 2020. 
In my leisure time, I like playing the piano and listening to classical music.
You can find some of the recordings of me playing the piano pieces <a href="/recordings">here. </a></p>
 <p>I also get interested in photography recently. Enjoy some of my favourite photos here. </p>
